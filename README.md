## Notes

When starting, I had initially created several classes in a CSS file. After running into many issues and finding myself unable to override certain Bootstrap CSS elements, I reached out to my classmates for help. I quickly realized that I needed to remove as much CSS as possible and rely on the Bootstrap CSS Framework to acheive the page requirements. The results were amazing, and my website responded as I intended.

Regarding the cards within the Portfolio page: I chose to keep my cards without a banner over the image, as I wanted the viewer to be able to see the entire image. I also felt it was important to have a brief description of each portfolio item for the viewer to digest.
