# Responsive-Portfolio

Created a mobile responsive portfolio using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. Contains About, Portfolio, and Contact pages. The assignment was required to have a navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images with minimal use of media queries.

Some notes regarding my work:

When starting, I had initially created several classes in a CSS file. After running into many issues and finding myself unable to override certain Bootstrap CSS elements, I reached out to my classmates for help. I quickly realized that I needed to remove as much CSS as possible and rely on the Bootstrap CSS Framework to acheive the page requirements. The results were amazing, and my website responded as I intended.
